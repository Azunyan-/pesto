# pesto
Pesto is an insanely simple, minimal, lightweight blogging platform.

# why?
Originally, I wrote [Basil](http://www.github.com/freefouran/basil). The platform was very simple, although, I considered Basil to be a project to get me into PHP. Now I know a bit more about PHP, there are a lot of things I've wanted to change, and improve, thus Pesto was born.

# requirements
There are a few things you will need for using Pesto.

* PHP 5.3.7 or above
* MySQL 4 or above
* A database

It is very important that you have PHP >= 5.3.7 This is because we use a library called password_compat for password hashing/encryption!

As for MySQL it's not as important, although you should have some knowledge of how to create a database. Table creation, and all the other MySQL related stuff is done for you.
